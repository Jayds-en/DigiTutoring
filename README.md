"# DigiTutoring"

A peer tutoring management application.

-Students register to apply for tutoring.  
-Tutors register and input their schedules, they then approve/deny student requests for tutoring.  
-Admins approve tutor registration, and may remove any user from the database.    

I create this application in 2017 for my 12th Grade IT PAT (aka. IT capstone project). DigiTutoring utelizes JAVA OOP, DBMS, SQL, HTML.
