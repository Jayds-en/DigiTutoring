"# DigiTutoring"

A peer tutoring management application.

Tutors register an account and input their schedules, they then approve/deny requests from students seeking tutoring. 
Students register to apply for tutoring. 
Admins approve tutor registration, and may delete any user data.

I create this application in 2017 for my 12th Grade IT PAT (aka. IT capstone project). DigiTutoring utelizes JAVA OOP, DBMS, SQL, HTML. 
It certainly has some bugs.
